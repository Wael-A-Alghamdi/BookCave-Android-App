# BookCave – Android Bookstore App

BookCave is a fully functional Android application for managing a digital bookstore. It includes two distinct user roles: **Customer** and **Seller**, each with their own UI, features, and workflows. The app allows book browsing, ordering, renting, profile management, seller uploads, and payment history tracking — all handled locally within the app.

##  Notes

- This app does **not** use a backend or database — all logic is handled client-side for demo purposes.
- User and seller actions are simulated using static logic and in-memory object storage.
- No payment gateway integration — only mock payment history screens exist.
- The app is optimized for smartphones only (portrait orientation).
